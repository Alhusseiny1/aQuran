#aQuran

A mobile-optimized, cross-platform Quran app built with web technologies.

##Why was this app created?
There are many Quran apps for each mobile platform, but none of them is perfect. Some apps display pictures of pages instead of text, which requires a lot of space and restricts the view to pages. Other apps lack search function or are simply non intuitive.

I wanted to build a cross-platform Quran app that has advanced features but is still easy to use.

_aQuran_ has the following features:

* __Cross-platform__: aQuran is built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript so it is easily portable to any platform.
* __Advanced search features__: ignore/strict diacritics, ignore/strict Alef hamza, match whole word...
* __Recitations__: all recitations provided by [http://everyayah.com](EveryAyah) are supported.
* __Translations__: all translations provided by the [http://zekr.org](Zekr project) are supported.
